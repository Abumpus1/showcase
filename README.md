#### About the Project
**SaveGame** is a project designed to provide to users the best available deals for games online.

This was part of a Turing School of Software & Design solo project with the learning goals to successfully implement React, React Router, E2E testing via Cypress, and fetch calls to an API of our choice, while also creating an app that is responsive to desktop or mobile.

## Instructions on Use

**_Dashboard_**

When a user visits SaveGame, they will be shown the top deals on 6 selected stores, and if a user clicks on a game title on the dashboard or the Search page, it will redirect them to the store page for that game.

**_Search Page_**

User is able to view all game deals, search for specific titles, and set a price limit on what gets displayed.

### Challenges and Wins

##### Challenges
- Finding an API that had good documentation that I was interested in, and learning how to best implement it.

##### Wins
- Learning to add responsiveness to my application, the payoff is vastly bigger than the effort required, which turned out to be less effort (in most cases) than expected.

#### Future Additions
- Allow for infinite scrolling on search page
- Allow user to have better filtering options, such as sorting by store or having a minimum price
